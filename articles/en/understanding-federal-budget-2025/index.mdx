# Federal Budget 2025: What We Know So Far

As we approach the release of the Fall 2025 Budget on November 4, a clearer picture is emerging of Canada’s fiscal landscape. Based on government announcements, leaks, preliminary data, and spending projections, Canada Spends can piece together what the Fall 2025 Budget might look like. Overall, the story is one of fiscal constraint alongside strategic investments.

## The Big Picture: A Tightening Budget

The projected numbers for the Fall 2025 Budget reveal a government attempting to balance competing priorities in an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment:

### What's Driving These Changes?

The most striking trend is the **decline in government revenue** (-3.5%) coupled with **nearly flat spending growth** (+0.5%). This combination has pushed the deficit up by 34% to a projected **$72.9 billion**, compared to 2024’s **$54.41 billion** deficit.

Several factors explain the revenue decline in the Fall 2025 Budget:

1. **Carbon Tax Phase-Out**: Reducing revenue by **$9.86B** annually.
2. **Income Tax Cuts (Bill C4)**: Passed in June 2025, the middle-class tax cut decreases revenue by **$5.4B** per year.
3. **Economic Headwinds**: Slower growth due to the U.S. trade war is substantially stifling activity and reducing tax revenue.

Meanwhile, operational spending, the amount the government spends on its own operations, is **down 2.9%**, reflecting the government’s July announcement to cut operational spending by **7.5%** in 2026–27. This plan appears to be taking effect ahead of schedule, and the full details of departmental cuts are highly anticipated. Will these figures be close to the 7.5% cut announced by the Minister of Finance in July, or will they come into effect at a slower pace? We will know for sure once the Fall 2025 Budget is out.

## Major New Investments

Despite overall restraint on government operations, Carney’s government has announced significant new capital investments in key areas, as promised in the Liberal Party's 2025 election platform.

### Defence & Security: ~$8.82B Increase

The largest single increase is in defence and security, Carney's main industrial policy:

- **$8.7B** in additional defence spending announced in August
- **$617.7M** over five years for the **Canada Border Services Agency** (≈ **$123.5M** in the first year)

Together, that’s roughly **$8.82B** in 2025–26, a **~30% increase** that moves Canada closer to NATO’s **2% of GDP** defence spending guideline. We will see if there are further investments in this area as Carney recently pledged to reach NATO's 5% GDP target in the next decade.

### Housing & Infrastructure: $13B

Announced in September, the **Build Canada Homes** program commits **$13B** to address the housing crisis through:

- New home construction
- Affordable housing initiatives
- Supporting infrastructure for development
- Reducing municipal housing development charges

### Economic Stimulus: $6.37B

In response to U.S. tariffs, the government unveiled a **“Buy Canadian”** industrial strategy with **$6.37B** in funding to:

- Support domestic manufacturing
- Protect Canadian industries
- Boost competitiveness

### Social Programs: $216.6M Annually

The **National School Food Program** will provide **$216.6M per year** to ensure children have access to nutritious meals.

## Where the Money Goes

## The Capital Investment Surge

Perhaps the most dramatic change is the **118.6% increase in capital investments**, rising from roughly **$18.8B** to **$41.2B**. The government's precise definitions of capital and operational spending will be clarified in the Fall 2025 Budget. Regardless, this surge reflects:

- Infrastructure projects (housing, transit)
- Defence equipment purchases
- Long-term economic development initiatives from Bill C5

These investments are unsurprising, as they were heavily touted and promised during the 2025 federal election.

## Operational Spending Cuts: The Quiet Story

While new investments grab headlines, the **2.9% reduction in operational spending** is equally significant—about **$5.3B** less in day-to-day government operations.

The July pledge to cut operational spending by **7.5% in 2026–27** suggests this trend will accelerate, potentially saving **$11.8B** annually once fully implemented.

So far, Carney’s government has said these savings will come from efficiencies and natural attrition in the civil service (retirements and voluntary departures). The Budget will reveal whether that holds true or if transfers to provinces and social programs will face reductions.

We’re also watching how the government defines **operational** versus **capital** spending in the Fall 2025 Budget. Our estimates reflect category allocations, but the Ministry of Finance may apply different definitions, an important distinction given Carney’s promise to **balance operational spending by 2027–28**.

That clarity will also show which departments absorb the largest cuts and how the Carney government will attempt to balance the Fall 2025 Budget.

## The Deficit Dilemma

The projected **$72.9B** deficit (up from **$54.41B** in 2024) raises important questions about Canada's fiscal sustainability. At approximately **2.4% of GDP**, it is higher than the government’s informal 2% target.

The cost to service Canada’s debt will likely rise from 2024’s **$47.27B**.

### What's Driving the Deficit?

1. **Revenue Shortfall**: Tax cuts and the carbon tax phase-out reduce income.
2. **Strategic Investments**: One-time capital spending on housing and infrastructure.
3. **Economic Conditions**: Slower growth from the U.S. Trade War dampens corporate, personal, and GST/HST receipts.taxes.

<Callout type="info">
The deficit increase is partially offset by the Carbon Tax Rebate phase-out (**$9.86B** in reduced expenses), which mirrors the revenue loss from ending the carbon tax. Since overall spending still exceeds revenue, the Carbon Tax Rebate phase-out further increases the deficit-to-GDP ratio.

## What This Means for Canadians

### Winners

- **Homebuyers**: The $13B housing push should increase supply and decrease housing prices across regions affected by Build Canada Homes.
- **Defence Sector**: Major spending increases could drive jobs and procurement in defence-related sectors across Canada.
- **Families with Children**: The National School Food Program expands support.
- **Manufacturing**: The “Buy Canadian” strategy offers a domestic edge.

### Trade-offs

- **Future Taxpayers**: A higher deficit means greater debt-servicing costs.
- **Federal Employees**: Operational cuts may reduce services or staffing levels across the Canadian civil service.
- **Tax Cuts**: Revenue-reducing tax cuts from Bill C4 limit future spending room.

## Looking Ahead: The November 4th Budget

When the official Fall 2025 Budget is released on November 4, key questions to watch include:

1. **Deficit Trajectory**: Is there a multi-year plan to return to the 2%-of-GDP target?
2. **Revenue Measures**: Will new taxes or other revenue sources address the budget shortfall?
3. **Program Cuts**: Which departments face the deepest reductions? And how quickly will they be affected?
4. **Economic Growth Assumptions**: How optimistic is the government about the recovery?

## The Bottom Line

Based on current data, the FY 2025 budget reflects a government that is:

- **Investing strategically** in defence, housing, and competitiveness, consistent with the Liberal Party’s 2025 election platform.
- **Cutting operational costs** to reduce the amount spent on government itself and free up resources for capital investments across Canada.
- **Accepting a larger deficit** in the short term to fund capital projects, such as Build Canada Homes.
- **Facing revenue pressures** from tax cuts and economic headwinds due to the U.S. Trade War and economic inefficiencies.

The core question is whether these investments will generate enough growth to justify the larger deficit or whether Canada faces a period of more aggressive spending restraint ahead.

We will only know once the Fall 2025 Budget is released on November 4th.

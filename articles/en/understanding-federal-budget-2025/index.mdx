# Federal Budget 2025: What We Know So Far

As we approach the official Fall 2025 Budget release on November 4th, a clearer picture is emerging of Canada's fiscal landscape. Based on government announcements, leaks, preliminary data, and spending projections, we can piece together what the 2025 Fall Budget might look like. Overall, the story it tells is one of fiscal constraint alongside strategic investments.

## The Big Picture: A Tightening Budget

The projected numbers for Fall 2025 Budget reveal a government attempting to balance competing priorities in an uncertain economic and geopoltiical environment:

### What's Driving These Changes?

The most striking trend is the **decline in government revenue** (-3.5%) coupled with **nearly flat spending growth** (+0.5%). This combination has pushed the deficit up by 34% to a projected $72.9 billion compared to 2024's $54.41 billion deficit.

Several factors explain the revenue decline in the Fall 2025 Budget:

1. **Carbon Tax Phase-Out**: Reducing revenue by $9.86B annually
2. **Income Tax Cuts (Bill C4)**: Passed in June 2025, Bill C4's middle-class tax cut decreases revenue by $5.4B per year
3. **Economic Headwinds**: Slower growth due to the US Trade War is substantially stifling growth and affecting tax revenue

Meanwhile, operational spending, the amount the government is spending on its own operations, is actually **down 2.9%**, reflecting the government's July announcement to cut operational spending by 7.5% in 2026-27. This plan appears to be taking effect ahead of schedule and the full details of spending cuts across departments is one we greatly anticipate. Will these figures be close to the 7.5% cut announced by the Minister of Finance in July or will they come into effect at a slower pace.

## Major New Investments

Despite overall spending restraint on government itself, Carney's government has announced significant new capital investments in key areas as promised in their 2025 Election Platform:

### Defence & Security: $8.82B Increase

The largest single increase comes from defence spending:

- **$8.7B** additional defence spending announced in August
- **$617.7M** over 5 years for Canadian Border Security Agency

This represents a **30% increase** in defence spending, bringing Canada closer to NATO's 2% GDP target. We will see if there are further investments in this area as Carney recently pledged to reach NATO's 5% GDP target in the next decade.

### Housing & Infrastructure: $13B

The Build Canada Homes program, announced in September, commits $13B to address Canada's housing crisis through:

- New home construction
- Affordable housing initiatives
- Infrastructure to support development
- Cuts to housing development charges

### Economic Stimulus: $6.37B

In response to U.S. tariffs, the government unveiled a "Buy Canadian" industrial strategy with $6.37B in funding to:

- Support domestic manufacturing
- Protect Canadian industries
- Boost competitiveness

### Social Programs: $216.6M Annually

The National School Food Program will provide $216.6M per year to ensure children have access to nutritious meals.

## Where the Money Goes

## The Capital Investment Surge

Perhaps the most dramatic change is the **118.6% increase in capital investments**, jumping from around $18.8B to $41.2B. Of course, the government's definition of what defines as capital spend will be better known with the Fall 2025 Budget.Regardless, this surge reflects:

- Infrastructure Projects (housing, transit)
- Defence Equipment Purchases
- Long-Term Economic Development Initiatives

These investments are unsurprising as they have been touted and promised during the 2025 Federal Election.

## Operational Spending Cuts: The Quiet Story

While new investments grab headlines, the **2.9% reduction in operational spending** is equally significant. This translates to approximately $5.3B in reduced day-to-day government operations.

The July announcement of a 7.5% operational spending cut for 2026-27 suggests this trend will accelerate, potentially saving $11.8B annually once fully implemented.

Carney's government thus far have said that these cuts will come from efficiencies and natural attrition in the civil service from retirements and people leaving their jobs. The Budget will reveal if this is the case.

As well, we are interested in seeing the government's definition of operational versus capital spending. Our estimates are based on the allocated amounts in each category, however, the Ministry of Finance may have their own definition. This is an important distinction to make because of Carney's promise to balance the operational spending of government by 2027-2028.

This would show which departments are absorbing the largest cuts.

## The Deficit Dilemma

The projected $72.9B deficit (up from $47.27B) raises important questions about fiscal sustainability. At approximately **2.4% of GDP**, this is higher than the government's informal 2% target.

The cost to service Canada's debt will likely rise from 2024's $47.27 billion.

### What's Driving the Deficit?

1. **Revenue Shortfall**: Tax cuts and carbon tax phase-out reducing income
2. **Strategic Investments**: One-time capital expenditures on housing and infrastructure
3. **Economic Conditions**: Slower growth reducing tax receipts on corporate and income taxes as well as GST/HST sales taxes.

<Callout type="info">
The increase in deficit is partially offset by the carbon tax rebate phase-out ($9.86B in reduced expenses), which mirrors the revenue reduction from ending the carbon tax. However, since Canada's spending is greater than its revenue, this negatively affects the deficit percentages.

## What This Means for Canadians

### Winners

- **Homebuyers**: $13B housing investment may increase supply
- **Defence Sector**: Major spending increase creates jobs
- **Families with Children**: National School Food Program support
- **Manufacturing**: "Buy Canadian" policy provides domestic advantage

### Trade-offs

- **Future Taxpayers**: Higher deficit means more debt servicing costs
- **Federal Employees**: Operational cuts may mean reduced services or staffing
- **Tax Cuts**: Revenue reductions limit future spending flexibility

## Looking Ahead: The November 4th Budget

When the official Fall 2025 Budget drops on November 4th, key questions to watch include:

1. **Deficit Trajectory**: Multi-year plan to return to 2% of GDP target?
2. **Revenue Measures**: New taxes or revenue sources to address shortfall?
3. **Program Cuts**: Which departments face the deepest reductions?
4. **Economic Growth Assumptions**: How optimistic is the government about recovery?

## The Bottom Line

Based on current data, the FY 2025 budget represents a government:

- **Investing strategically** in defence, housing, and economic competitiveness as promised in the Liberal's 2025 Platform.
- **Cutting operational costs** and reducing the amount spent on government itself to free up resources
- **Accepting a larger deficit** in the short term to fund capital projects
- **Facing revenue challenges** from tax cuts and economic headwinds

The key question is whether these strategic investments will generate enough economic growth to justify the larger deficit, or if Canada faces a difficult period of more aggressive spending cuts ahead.

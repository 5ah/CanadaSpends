For "Legislative Assembly" doen't have any granular breakdown of it's data. So, we are considering the Provincial audited data only.

Provincial level, the data is audited, but at the department or the ministry level, the financial data is not audited. So that is the reason we have added the difference between these amounts as unreported.

For the revenues, we have considered high level data only and for the expenses, we have considered individual ministry level data and compared it against the provincial level audited data and finally reported the difference between these amounts as unreported.

The financial reports are actually present in PDFs. The images present in the "raw data - images"" folder is the screenshots of these finacial reports from these PDFs.

The CSV reports are an intermediate. All the CSV files are the modified, calculated data that is present in PDFs, but modified according to the requirements of this data visualization so that it's easy to make JSONs by referring to these CSVs.

All the data that's represented in CSV and JSON files are in Billion dollars.

Under "Taxpayer-supported Debt Servicing Costs - Capital Plan" 122M dollars $was mentioned as "Education (school P3s) / Transportation (ring road P3s)".

Although in Minitry of Transportation and Economic Corridors's expenses, 116M dollars was mentioned as expense for "Ring Roads - Debt Servicing", we didn't consider it as it is unaudited and hence not reliable.

Treasury board and finance ministry has "Change in unfunded pension obligations" as "-327M$" which is equal to the "unreported" amount. So, this needs a speacial attention ig.

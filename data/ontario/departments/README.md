# Department JSON Files - Content Editing Guide

This directory contains JSON files for all Ontario government departments/ministries. These files control both the spending data visualization and the text content that appears on each department's page on the CanadaSpends website.

## üìù What You Can Edit

Each department JSON file contains **editable text fields** that control the content shown to website visitors. Look for these fields in each file:

### Editable Content Fields

- **`introText`** - Short introduction that appears at the top of the department page
- **`descriptionText`** - Detailed description including spending amounts and context
- **`roleText`** - Description of the department's role and importance to the province
- **`programsHeading`** - Heading for the programs and services section
- **`programsDescription`** - Description of what programs and services this department offers
- **`leadershipHeading`** - Heading for the leadership and oversight section
- **`leadershipDescription`** - Description of the department's leadership structure and oversight mechanisms
- **`prioritiesHeading`** - Local H2 heading for department-specific priorities section
- **`prioritiesDescription`** - Description of the department's key priorities and focus areas (supports bullet points with `‚Ä¢`)

## üö´ What NOT to Edit

**Do not modify these fields** as they contain critical data used for visualizations:

- `name` - Official department name
- `totalSpendingFormatted` - Formatted spending amount
- `percentage` - Spending percentage
- `percentageFormatted` - Formatted percentage
- `categories` - Spending breakdown data
- `spending_data` - Hierarchical spending data for charts
- `generatedAt` - File generation timestamp

## üìã How to Edit Content

### 1. Find Your Department

Open the appropriate `.json` file for the department you want to edit (e.g., `health.json`, `education.json`).

### 2. Locate the Editable Fields

Scroll to the bottom of the file to find the editable content fields:

```json
"introText": "Your intro text here...",
"descriptionText": "Your detailed description...",
"roleText": "Description of the department's role...",
"programsHeading": "Your programs section heading",
"programsDescription": "Description of programs and services...",
"leadershipHeading": "Your leadership section heading",
"leadershipDescription": "Description of leadership and oversight...",
"prioritiesHeading": "Your priorities section heading",
"prioritiesDescription": "Description of priorities with bullet points:\n\n‚Ä¢ Priority 1 ‚Äì Description here\n‚Ä¢ Priority 2 ‚Äì Description here"
```

### 3. Edit the Text

- Keep text **clear and informative**
- Use **proper grammar and spelling**
- Maintain a **professional tone**
- Keep **introText relatively short** (1-2 sentences)
- Make **descriptionText more detailed** but still concise

### 4. Use Template Variables (Optional)

You can use these placeholders in your text that will be automatically replaced:

- `{department.name}` - The department's official name
- `{jurisdiction.name}` - "Ontario"
- `{department.totalSpendingFormatted}` - e.g., "$82.9B"
- `{department.percentageFormatted}` - e.g., "40.1%"
- `{jurisdiction.totalProvincialSpendingFormatted}` - "$206.6B"
- `{jurisdiction.financialYear}` - "2023-24"

## üí° Editing Tips & Best Practices

### Good Examples:

**Intro Text:**

```json
"introText": "The Ministry of Health is responsible for Ontario's healthcare system, ensuring accessible, high-quality medical care and public health services for all Ontarians across the province."
```

**Description Text:**

```json
"descriptionText": "The Ontario Ministry of Health spent $82.9B in fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, representing 40.1% of the $206.6B in total provincial spending. This substantial investment ensures Ontarians have access to hospitals, physicians, public health programs, and essential medical services."
```

### Avoid:

- ‚ùå Very long sentences or paragraphs
- ‚ùå Technical jargon that the public won't understand
- ‚ùå Political language or partisan statements
- ‚ùå Outdated information or specific years (use template variables instead)
- ‚ùå Modifying non-editable fields

### Using Bullet Points in Priorities

For the `prioritiesDescription` field, you can create bullet points using the following format:

```json
"prioritiesDescription": "Department focuses on these key areas:\n\n‚Ä¢ Priority Name ‚Äì Description of this priority\n‚Ä¢ Another Priority ‚Äì Description of this priority\n‚Ä¢ Third Priority ‚Äì Description of this priority"
```

**Important formatting notes:**

- Use `‚Ä¢` (bullet character) at the start of each bullet point
- Separate priority name and description with `‚Äì` (space, dash, space)
- Use `\n\n` for line breaks between sections
- The priority names will automatically appear in **bold** on the website

## üîç Comments Section

Each file includes a `_comments` section that provides guidance:

```json
"_comments": {
  "_editing_guide": "The fields below can be edited to customize the department page content. These texts will appear on the public website.",
  "_introText": "Short introduction that appears at the top of the department page",
  "_descriptionText": "Detailed description - you can use placeholder variables like {jurisdiction.name}, {department.name}, etc.",
  "_roleText": "Description of the department's role and importance to the province",
  "_programsHeading": "Heading for the programs and services section",
  "_programsDescription": "Description of what programs and services this department offers"
}
```

**Note:** The `_comments` section is for editor guidance only and is **not displayed** to website visitors.

## üåê How Changes Appear

When you edit these fields:

1. **Website pages automatically update** with your new content
2. **Content is displayed in both English and French** (through our translation system)
3. **Template variables get replaced** with actual values
4. **Comments remain hidden** from public visitors

            Use this tool to search how the Government of Canada spends money.

            Government of Canada sources including Grants and Contributions,
            Contracts over $10K, Contracts under $10K, and Research funding
            databases (SSHRC, NSERC, CIHR), Global Affairs Canada projects. Type
            in one or more keywords and filter the results by year, department,
            or location to explore the data.
